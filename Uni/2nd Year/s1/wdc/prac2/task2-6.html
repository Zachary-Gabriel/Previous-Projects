		<h1>Check out my borders</h1>
		<p>We've modified the content div to have a 1px darkgrey border with rounded corners of an 8px radius.</p>
		<p>Other elements have borders too, <span class=red-border>like this span with the class red-border</span>.</p>
		<hr>
		<p>You can change the color of horizontal rules by changing the border color<br>all horizontal rules are now #9FEFE4</p>
		<p>Alternately, <span class=red-outline>this span has a red outline (red-outline class).</span><br>That prevents it from messing with the line height.</p>
	</div>
	<p>Notice how the borders double up here:</p>
	<div class=box1>
		<p>This div has a red border</p>
	</div>
	<div class=box2>
		<p>This div has a blue border</p>
	</div>
	<p>Notice how this fixes the borders:</p>
	<div class=box3>
		<p>This div has a red border, except on the bottom, and 8px round to corners</p>
	</div><div class=box4>
		<p>This div has a blue border, and 8px round bottom corners</p>
	</div>
